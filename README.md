# Transform-an-excel-workbook-to-report-in-Power-BI
A report generated in Power BI from data in Excel to answer product performance across time periods in different geographic regions.
The report seeks to answer three questions from the data present in the Excel workbook:
1. Which month and year had the most profit?
2. Where is the company seeing the most success (by country/region)?
3. Which product and segment should the company continue to invest in?
